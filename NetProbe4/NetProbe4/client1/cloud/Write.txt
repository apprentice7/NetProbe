- Released: 3 April 2015

Remarks
1. Most of features in marking scheme 2, 3 and 4 are finished
2. It is not a complete version, e.g.,
- It does not support non-existing directory for synchronization;
- It does not support features in marking scheme 5, e.g., directory synchronization;
- The program can only be run under Windows.
3. You need to create the directory structure (at both Server and Client) in the following format:
- name/cloud/, where name is the specified directory. All files in name/cloud/* will be synchonized;
- some temporary files will be created under name/. These files facilite debug, and will not be synchronized.
